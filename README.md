## What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment. It refers to a software engineering practice that aims to automate and optimize the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes.

In a CI/CD workflow, developers integrate their code changes frequently, usually several times a day. Every time a change is made and committed to the code repository, a pipeline of automated build, test, and deployment tasks is triggered. The pipeline checks the integrity of the code, runs tests to ensure that it's working as expected, and then deploys the code to production if all the tests pass.

The goal of CI/CD is to enable faster and more reliable code releases by automating and streamlining the build, test, and deployment process. It helps to catch and fix errors early in the development cycle, and it makes it easier for developers to collaborate and work on code changes in parallel.

CI/CD is often used in conjunction with version control systems (such as Git), code repositories (such as GitLab), and continuous integration (CI) and deployment (CD) tools (such as Jenkins or GitLab CI). These tools help to automate and manage the various tasks involved in the CI/CD process.

To implement CI/CD in your development workflow, you'll need to use a combination of tools and processes, such as:

A version control system, such as Git, to manage and track code changes
A code repository, such as GitLab, to host your code and manage the CI/CD process
A continuous integration (CI) and deployment (CD) tool, such as Jenkins or GitLab CI, to automate and manage the various tasks involved in the CI/CD process
Scripts and configuration files, such as a .gitlab-ci.yml file, to define the tasks and steps involved in the CI/CD process
To learn more about CI/CD and how to implement it in your development workflow, you can refer to online documentation and tutorials, such as the following resources:

- The GitLab documentation on CI/CD: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/
- The Jenkins documentation on CI/CD: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/continuous-delivery/
- The Atlassian documentation on CI/CD: https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/ci-vs-ci-cd
